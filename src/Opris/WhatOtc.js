                    <h2>What is OTC Crypto Exchange ?</h2>
                    <p>An OTC (Over-the-Counter) Crypto Exchange is a platform that allows the direct trading of cryptocurrencies between buyers and sellers, bypassing traditional exchanges. Instead of placing orders on a public order book like on centralized exchanges, transactions are executed privately between two parties, often with a broker or intermediary facilitating the trade.</p>
                    <p>OTC exchanges are particularly useful for large transactions or institutional investors who want to avoid price slippage or market disruption, ensuring a smoother and more secure process. The process often includes services such as price negotiation, secure payment methods, and escrow services to guarantee the safety of both parties involved.</p>
